# ScreepsOS AI

# Goal: 
Redesign light kernalOS to be used for our bot to live out of. All functions and commands are than operated as programs and help dictate to each other when a program is needed and try and introduce a scheduling system if ticks ever go over the limit to spread across several ticks instead of hitting an error and potentially breaking down  


prep:
`npm install`

to build:
`npm run build`

to build & deploy: (Requires a valid auth.js)
`npm run deploy`

IF you don't use `npm`, `yarn` will work the same
